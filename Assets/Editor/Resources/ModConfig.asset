  description: "IT'S FINALLY READY FOR RERELEASE!!!\n\n\u2014ahem, this is my modded
    module, Needy Shape Memory. It's based off of a game that I'm not sure even has
    a name, and it requires you to use your memory to compare shapes to shapes to
    keep your timer up. If you run out of time or make a mistake, you risk taking
    one step closer to an explosion.\n\nIf you have any issues or suggestions, your
    best bet is to contact me on Discord, either through DMs or through the KTANE
    Discord server. My username is UltraCboy#4639.\n\nModule ID: needyShapeMemory\nManual
    Page: Available in the build folder, also available at https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Shape%20Memory.html\n\nThank
    you, sorry for the long wait, and happy defusing!"
